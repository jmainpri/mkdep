README for CNRS/LAAS mkdep
==========================

This is LAAS mkdep, an automatic dependencies generation program for C
and C++ source code. 

Its main original feature is to be able to incrementally rebuild
dependencies only for files that have been touched since the last
mkdep execution.

Other features include the ablilities to generate dependency rules for
libraries or for objects files stored in a separate directory, and to
apply some transforms on the name of included files, for example to
use a make variable to hold a common prefix for included files. 

This utility is used by the Makefiles shipped by other software
available from the CNRS/LAAS. 

See the INSTALL document for compilation and installation
instructions.
