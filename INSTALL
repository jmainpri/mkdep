installation instructions for LAAS mkdep
========================================

This program is using a GNU configure shell script to attempt to guess
correct values for various system-dependent variables used during
compilation. 

The standard way to compile this package is:

- ./configure --prefix=<your-installation-directory>
- make
- make install

This will build the 'mkdep' program and install it ${prefix}/bin. 

Compiler and options
--------------------

  If your system needs a special compiler or special C compiler flags
  to build 'mkdep', you can specify them on the configure command line
  like this: 

      env CC=gcc CFLAGS=-O0 ./configure --prefix=...

Compiling for multiple architectures
------------------------------------

  You can compile 'mkdep' for multiple architectures or multiple
  Operating system version by using a separate directory to place
  object files for each different build. To this, create a
  system-dependant directory, 'cd' to it and execute configure from
  it. For instance: 
 
  mkdir i386-linux
  cd i386-linux
  ../configure --prefix=....
  make 
  make install
